# Quiz Timer

## Instalation:

Simply open the github link and take the quiz!

## Usage:

This program is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of making a quiz by using javascript. This program is far from finished and requires polishing on all ends but is made to show some of the core components that make it what it is. It still has many features missing for now but will be patched in future updates.
